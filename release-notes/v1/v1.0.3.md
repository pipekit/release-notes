This update deprecates the `pipekit.io` domain for the Pipekit API. The API is now available at `api.pipekit.io`. This change is part of our ongoing effort to improve the security and reliability of the Pipekit platform.

Existing installations of the Pipekit Agent, Pipekit Python SDK and Pipekit CLI will stop working after 2024-05-01. To continue using these tools with Pipekit, you should upgrade them to v1.0.3 or greater.
